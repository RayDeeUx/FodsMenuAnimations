# HJfod's Menu Animations Reborn Changelog
## v1.2.4
- Added a new setting:  `Move Menus Instead Of Moving Individual Buttons`  .
- Fix a really obscure oversight.
## v1.2.3
- Port to GD 2.2081.
- Declare an incompatibility with Main Menu Minus as it is beginning to get ridiculously tiresome to keep up with the vibecoded nonsense that keeps getting published lately.
## v1.2.2
- Refactor a few things here and there for slightly more robust compatability. (I hope.)
## v1.2.1
- Added `Animation Mode` to adjust when the animation should play. (Requested by [catgirldev](https://github.com/AnhNguyenlost13))
  - Default setting is `Always` to preserve past mod behavior.
  - Other options include `Only From Loading Screen`, `Once per Game Launch`, and `Only on Button`.
## v1.2.0
- Added an animation replay button.
- Added an option to queue the animation for one frame, because some folks needed that for some reason.
## v1.1.0
- Added `Animation Speed`, `Animation Delay`, and `Additional Animation Duration` for those who want to adjust the animation's properties.
- The player is far less likely to show up before the ground finishes moving.
- Remove last traces of lag. (Hopefully.)
## v1.0.0
- Initial release (on GitHub).
