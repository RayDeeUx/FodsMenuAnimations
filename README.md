# HJfod's Menu Animations Reborn

### <c-ffff55>As seen on</c> <c-ff0000>You</c>Tube<c-ffff55>...for some reason!</c> ([EVW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHZDz2UpNk4&t=703))

HJfod's menu animations mod from the old days of GD 2.1 (remember ModLdr, Mega Hack v6 extensions, GDHM, or Italian Apk Downloader's mod menu?), ported to Geode (with permission)!

For a recap of what this mod does in HJfod's own words:

> `This is a mod that makes your menu layer have a wacky animation every time you enter it.`
> 
> `...that's it.`

Comes with support for [Overcharged Main Menu](https://github.com/Weebifying/ReDash-geode) out of the box.

Thanks to [km7](https://github.com/km7dev) and [hiimjasmine00](https://github.com/hiimjasmine00) for testing and bugsquashing!
