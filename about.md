# HJfod's Menu Animations Reborn
HJfod's menu animations mod from the old days of GD 2.1 (remember ModLdr, Mega Hack v6 extensions, GDHM, or Italian Apk Downloader's mod menu?), ported to Geode v5 (with permission)!

For a recap of what this mod does in HJfod's own words:

> `This is a mod that makes your menu layer have a wacky animation every time you enter it.`
> 
> `...that's it.`

Comes with support for Overcharged Main Menu out of the box.

Could this mod's features have been replicated with [Happy Textures](mod:alphalaneous.happy_textures)?\
Sure.\
Am I going to do that?\
No.
