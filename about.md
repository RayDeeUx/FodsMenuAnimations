# HJfod's Menu Animations Reborn
HJfod's menu animations mod from the old days of GD 2.1 (remember ModLdr, Mega Hack v6 extensions, GDHM, or Italian Apk Downloader's mod menu?), ported to Geode (with permission)!

For a recap of what this mod does in HJfod's own words:

> `This is a mod that makes your menu layer have a wacky animation every time you enter it.`
> 
> `...that's it.`

Comes with support for [Overcharged Main Menu](mod:ninxout.redash) out of the box.

Could this mod's features have been replicated with [Happy Textures](mod:alphalaneous.happy_textures)?\
Sure.\
Am I going to do that?\
No.

To any "Nelly Nitpickers" or to those who used to use this mod in 2.1, you might notice *slight* deviations from the original animation. Such changes were minimal, and were meant to ensure better compatibility/interoperability with most, if not all, past/present/future mods on the Geode index.

Thanks to [km7](https://github.com/km7dev) and [hiimjasmine00](https://github.com/hiimjasmine00) for testing and bugsquashing!
